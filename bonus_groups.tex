\begin{enumerate}
 \item Let \(G\) be generated by \(a\), \(b\) such that \(aba^{-1} = b^2\) and
       \(bab^{-1} = a^2\). What is the order of \(G\)?
 \item Is it true that \(K \nsgp H \nsgp G \implies K \nsgp G\)?
 \item Show that any subgroup of \(A_5\) of order 12 is isomorphic to \(A_4\).
       Show that there are precisely five such subgroups.
 \item Let \(H \nsgp D_{2n}\) be a normal subgroup consisting of rotations.
       Describe \(D_{2n} / H\).
 \item Show that the dihedral group \(D_{2n}\) may be generated by two elements
       of order 2. Show that a finite group generated by two elements of order
       2 is isomorphic to some (possibly degenerate) dihedral group \(D_{2n}\).
         Can \(D_{2n}\) be generated by a set containing no elements of order 2?
 \item Using cross-ratios, prove Ptolemy’s theorem, which states that for any
       quadrilateral whose vertices lie on a circle, the product of the lengths
       of the diagonals equals the sum of the products of the lengths of pairs
       of opposite sides.
 \item Write down a finite group \(G\) having a non-normal subgroup of index
       \(5\). Is there an example where \(G\) has odd order?
 \item Define the \emph{order sequence} of a finite group to be a list of the
       orders of its elements, written in increasing order. For example, \(S_3\)
       has order sequence \((1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3)\). If two finite groups have the
       same order sequence, must they be isomorphic?
 \item Is there a non-cyclic group of order \(55\)? Is there a non-cyclic group
       of order \(65\)?
 \item Let \(X\) be a (non-empty) set with an associative binary operation, such
       that for every \(x \in X\) there is a unique \(x'\) such that
       \(xx'x = x\). Prove that \(X\) is a group.
 \item Which groups contain a (non-zero) even number of elements of order \(2\)?
 \item Let \(G\) be a group, \(H \sgp G\) , and \(g \in G\). If
       \(gHg^{-1} \subset H\), must we have \(gHg^{-1} = H\)?
 \item Let \(G\) be a finite group, and \(H\) a subgroup of \(G\). Show that we
       can choose common representatives of the left and right cosets – that is,
       choose \(g_1, \dotsc, gk\) such that the left cosets are
       \(g_1 H, \dotsc, g_k H\) and the right cosets are
       \(H g_1, \dotsc, H g_k\).
 \item Let \(G\) be a finite non-abelian group. Show that at most \(\frac 58\)
       of the pairs of elements of \(G\) commute, and show that this bound
       cannot be improved.
 \item Which finite groups have exactly one non-identity automorphism? Find an
       infinite group, other than \(\Z\), with this property.
 \item Write down a countably infinite group having exactly two automorphisms.
       Is there an uncountable group with this property?
 \item Which finite groups have the property that all non-identity elements are
       conjugate? Is there an infinite group with this property?
 \item For which natural numbers \(n\) is there a unique group of order \(n\)?
 \item Let \(G\) and \(H\) be groups such that
       \(G \times \Z \isom H \times \Z\). Show that if \(G\) and \(H\) are
       abelian then they must be isomorphic. If they are non-abelian, must they
       be isomorphic?
 \item Is it true that for every finite group \(G\) there exists a subset of
       \(\R^n\) whose symmetry group is isomorphic to \(G\)?
