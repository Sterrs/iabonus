      \begin{enumerate}
            \item Let $G$ be generated by $a$, $b$ such that $aba^{-1} = b^2$ and $bab^{-1} = a^2$.
                  What is the order of $G$?
            \item Is it true that $K \triangleleft H \triangleleft G \implies K \triangleleft G$?
            \item Show that any subgroup of $A_5$ of order 12 is isomorphic to $A_4$. Show that
                  there are precisely five such subgroups.
            \item Let $H \leq D_{2n}$ be a normal subgroup consisting of rotations. Describe $D_{2n} / H$.
            \item Show that the dihedral group $D_{2n}$ may be generated by two elements of order 2.
                  Show that a finite group generated by two elements of order 2 is isomorphic to
                  some (possibly degenerate) dihedral group $D_{2n}$. Can $D_{2n}$ be generated by a set
                  containing no elements of order 2?
            \item Using cross-ratios, prove Ptolemy’s theorem, which states that for any 
                  quadrilateral whose vertices lie on a circle, the product of the lengths of the
                  diagonals equals the sum of the products of the lengths of pairs of opposite sides.
            \item Write down a finite group $G$ having a non-normal subgroup of index $5$. Is there an
                  example where $G$ has odd order?
            \item Define the \textit{order sequence} of a finite group to be a
                  list of the orders of its elements,written in increasing order.
                  For example, $S_3$ has order sequence $(1,2,2,2,3,3)$. If two finite
                  groups have the same order sequence, must they be isomorphic?
            \item Is there a non-cyclic group of order $55$? Is there a non-cyclic
            group of order $65$?
            \item Let $X$ be a (non-empty) set with an associative binary operation,
            such that for every $x \in X$ there is a unique $x'$ such that $xx'x =x$.
            Prove that $X$ is a group.
            \item Which groups contain a (non-zero) even number of elements of order $2$?
            \item Let $G$ be a group, $H \leq G$ , and $g \in G$. If $gHg^{-1} \subset H$,
            must we have $gHg^{-1} = H$?
            \item Let $G$ be a finite group, and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. Show that we can 
            choose common representatives of the left and right cosets – that is,
            choose $g_1, \ldots, gk$ such that the left cosets are $g_1 H, \ldots, g_k H$
            and the right cosets are $H g_1, \ldots, H g_k$.
            \item Let $G$ be a finite non-abelian group. Show that at most $\frac{5}{8}$ of the pairs
            of elements of $G$ commute, and show that this bound cannot be improved.
            \item Which finite groups have exactly one non-identity automorphism?  Find an infinite
            group, other than $\mathbb{Z}$, with this property.
            \item Write down a countably infinite group having exactly two automorphisms. Is there an
            uncountable group with this property?
            \item Which finite groups have the property that all non-identity elements are conjugate?
            Is there an infinite group with this property?
            \item For which natural numbers $n$ is there a unique group of order $n$?
            \item Let $G$ and $H$ be groups such that $G \times \mathbb{Z} \cong H \times \mathbb{Z}$.
            Show that if $G$ and $H$ are abelian then they must be isomorphic. If they are non-abelian,
            must they be isomorphic?
            \item Is it true that for every finite group $G$ there exists a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$
            whose symmetry group is isomorphic to $G$?
      \end{enumerate}
